          <p>
            Ever had the feeling that there's a perfect software solution to your current work but you just don't have  the know how to make it happen? You're not the first, and you certainly won't be the last. Don't just leave it there though. Together, we can turn your idea into a reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialise in rapid prototyping and development, with a focus on agile methodologies. What does that mean for you? It means that we work together, on a regular basis, to bring you the software you actually need. No lengthy specifications or long periods of 'development', instead we'll create a set of easy to manage deliverables with a process of constant communication and improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            This agile methodology means you get the software you really want and need, and the software works for you. With regular meetings and specific deliverables, you'll get to see the software as it's developed and we'll make sure it works as it should.

          <p>
            If you've just transitioned to a new Operating System, platform, technology or software, you may have started noticing a drop in productivity from your staff or an increase in support calls from your customers. It's understandable, they're still learning and you need to give them time.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, you can improve their learning speed with a customised training session. Small, interactive training sessions provide staff or customers with an opportunity to get to know the new software, learning it's ins and outs and spend time on improving their skills and understanding of that software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Training sessions also provide an outlet for staff or customers to point out any problems or confusions they have with the software in a positive open environment. This gives you the opportunity to really get to know how well the software is being used and where you need to provide new or different options in the software itself and the training materials provided.
