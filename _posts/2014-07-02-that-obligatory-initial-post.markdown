This isn't the first blog I've ever started. Nor is it the second. I've always had this whisper in the back of my head that I should be writing a blog. Not for your sakes, mind you. More than anything, I think it's to give the voices in my head an outlet of sorts, somewhere to reveal their innermost dwindlings. My intention is for this blog to updated regularly, but I don't know how I'll go with that. While I quite like writing blog articles, they do take time and I don't have huge amounts of that available to me.

However, onwards and updwards, let's at least get this post out of the way. The most obligatory of blog posts. The initial post. There are any number of topics bouncing around in my head, based on my current work with NGOs, Javascript MVCs and API based systems (and a specific love for <abbr class="tipped" data-placement="bottom" title="Three Letter Acronyms">TLAs</abbr>). But for now, I think I'll discuss an article that coincidentally appeared in my LinkedIn feed a couple of days ago. [This article by Darren Rowse][article] is a discussion on 'Understanding your Reader' to make blog writing easier. Obviously, this is quite easy for me:

> My readership has a fairly solid base of not anybody, as well as a group of readers with specific interests in not existing.

Now that that's done, let's get down to the nitty gritty of imagining the readers who might be attracted to my blog and, on an even deeper level, what my purpose is with this blog. If I'm going to be fair, the 'purpose' of the blog is a little in flux still. Generally, the blog comes around when I'm rebuilding this website and it feels a little empty with just the one page. So I add a blog in. But I quite like the idea of writing regularly, to keep my skills up and get my ideas down on a page. There's a lot of great content out on the web (particularly in the fields I'm in), but it would take you a million million lifetimes to read all of it, so I don't expect there to be huge numbers of people clamouring to read my posts. However, I am tickled with the idea of someone reading my posts and being inspired or learning something.

So, who would I like to be reading my blog. People like me, more than anything. Young people who love new technology, are out there trying to be 'entrepeneurial' and people who want to have a future at the forefront of the tech world. On top of that, I'd like potential clients to see this and understand a little about the way I work, think and do.

Done! That's my first blog post. Alright, as we speak, I'm setting an alarm for next week (Friday 11/7/14) because by then I'd like to have another blog post out. I'm thinking __"An Exploration in Ember"__.
